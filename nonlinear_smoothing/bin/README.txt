After building the "tv" executable here (see ../code/README.txt), these
scripts will run tv with the appropriate parameters for each type of TV
minimaization:
run_ch.sh - runs tv with chambolle parameters.
run_pd.sh - runs tv with primal-dual parameters.
run_sb.sh - runs tv with split-bregman parameters.
